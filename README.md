# Mini Server - Fuelphp 1.8
I simply love building portable web application using portable web servers.
The best portable web server I could find is [Uniform Server](http://www.uniformserver.com/).

**Mini Server Fuelphp** is a ready-to-use portable server that uses [*Uniform Mini Server v1.0.11*](https://sourceforge.net/projects/miniserver/files/MiniServer/PHP_MiniServer/) 
and [*Fuelphp v1.8*](http://www.fuelphp.com/).

* [cache](https://github.com/bkader/mini-server-fuelphp/tree/master/root/cache), [logs](https://github.com/bkader/mini-server-fuelphp/tree/master/root/logs) and [modules](https://github.com/bkader/mini-server-fuelphp/tree/master/root/modules) folders have been moved out of [app](https://github.com/bkader/mini-server-fuelphp/tree/master/root/app) folder.
* This repository uses the *Mini Server version*, which means there will be absolutely no **MySQL**.
